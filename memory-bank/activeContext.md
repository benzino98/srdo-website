# Active Context: SRDO Website

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup and planning phase. We have established the project repository with separate frontend and backend directories. Documentation has been created to outline the project's requirements and structure.

## Recent Changes

- Created project repository with README
- Established initial documentation with requirements
- Set up frontend (React) and backend (Laravel) directories
- Created basic package.json for dependencies

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Project Structure**: We are using a decoupled architecture with separate frontend and backend codebases.
2. **Tech Stack Selection**:
   - Frontend: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion
   - Backend: Laravel PHP with MySQL database
3. **Component Organization**: Planning the component hierarchy for frontend
4. **API Design**: Designing the API endpoints and database schema

## Next Steps

### High Priority (Immediate Focus)

1. Set up frontend development environment with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind
2. Configure Laravel backend with necessary dependencies
3. Create basic database migrations for core entities (projects, news, resources)
4. Implement frontend routing structure
5. Design and implement base layout components (header, footer, navigation)

### Medium Priority

1. Develop API endpoints for core entities
2. Create frontend components for home page
3. Implement contact form functionality
4. Set up authentication for admin section

### Low Priority (Future Work)

1. Implement animations with Framer Motion
2. Optimize for performance
3. Set up deployment pipeline
4. Add advanced features like search functionality

## Open Questions

1. What specific projects should be featured on the home page?
2. Are there any specific design requirements or branding guidelines to follow?
3. How will content be managed (CMS integration vs. custom admin panel)?
4. What are the specific content types and fields needed for the projects and news sections?

## Current Challenges

1. Ensuring optimal performance on shared hosting
2. Planning for efficient deployment process
3. Designing a scalable database schema that accommodates future content needs
4. Balancing modern frontend features with broad browser compatibility
